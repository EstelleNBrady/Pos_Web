      <h1>About This Blog</h1>
      <p>
        This blog is for people who want to get into fitness or are into fitness but want
a body neutral and body positive place to do that. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The fitness industry can be very fat-phobic
and this is a safe place to find workouts but also discuss anything fitness related without it
having to pertain to your body size. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can post under any of the blogs I put out, express
yourself (just make sure to keep it kind)!
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jessica and Iâ€™m a certified personal trainer along with a certified group fitness
instructor based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. I have always loved fitness because it makes me
feel strong, confident, and athletic. I have instructed numerous group fitness classes over the
years including bootcamp, tabata, total body toning, core, cardio pilates, and traditional pilates
classes. I have also worked with numerous clients one on one to help them reach their goals. I
am also a big runner and I have ran a handful of marathons and half marathons.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe
exercise should be a fun challenge, and that we should do it out of love and appreciation for our
bodies, not because we hate our bodies. I am hoping to help people change how they see
fitness and show them ways of exercise that will make them feel more powerful than ever
before.
